<div class="chapter">
<a id="about"/><h1>1 - About Aperture Scripting</h1>

<p>Aperture Scripting is a set of Lua libraries to manipulate Gerber (RS-274X) files and other related vector files. It was designed as a generic framework to let custom scripts manipulate PCB design data, in particular assemble several PCBs into panels. It is also used by my <a href="http://piratery.net/grbv/">Gerber Viewer</a> application to load PCB data files for visualization.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>

<p>All support is done through direct email to me at <a href="mailto:jerome.vuarand@gmail.com">jerome.vuarand@gmail.com</a>. You might also be able to contact me through the <a href="http://www.lua.org/lua-l.html">Lua mailing list</a> if your question is somewhat related to the Lua language and how to use it, or through the <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/forum/">Dangerous Prototypes forums</a> for questions related to PCB design and Gerber data creation (most likely exported from a CAD software).</p>

<p>Feel free to ask for further developments. I can't guarantee that I'll develop everything you ask, but I want my code to be as useful as possible, so I'll do my best to help you. And if you find a bug please report it to me so that I can fix it for you and all the other users (this may seem obvious but automated crash reports in my Gerber Viewer demonstrated that very few people report their problems).</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>These libraries are written and maintained by <a href="mailto:jerome.vuarand@gmail.com">Jérôme Vuarand</a>.</p>

<p>Aperture Scripting is available under an <a href="LICENSE.txt">MIT-style license</a>.</p>

<p>The logo was inspired by another kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)#Setting">Aperture</a>, another kind of <a href="http://www.gerber.com/">Gerber</a> and by the <a href="http://www.lua.org/images/">Lua logo</a>. Hopefully it will be seen as a tribute rather than a copyright infringement.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<a id="download"/><h1>2 - Download</h1>

<p>Aperture Scripting sources are available in its <a href="http://hg.piratery.net/aperture-scripting/">Mercurial repository</a>:</p>

<pre><code>hg clone http://hg.piratery.net/aperture-scripting/
</code></pre>

<p>Tarballs of the latest code can be downloaded directly from there: as <a href="http://hg.piratery.net/aperture-scripting/get/tip.tar.gz">gz</a>, <a href="http://hg.piratery.net/aperture-scripting/get/tip.tar.bz2">bz2</a> or <a href="http://hg.piratery.net/aperture-scripting/get/tip.zip">zip</a>.</p>

<p>If you're on Windows, and you don't have a working Lua installation, I recommend you download one of my <a href="http://piratery.net/grbv/downloads/">Gerber Viewer packages</a>. It contains Aperture Scripting, along with a full working set of compiled libraries, a Lua interpreter and Lua modules, including all the mandatory and optional dependencies listed below. And as a bonus you get a 3D viewer for your generated PCBs files.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<a id="installation"/><h1>3 - Installation</h1>

<p>Aperture Scripting is not (at the moment) designed to be installed. Rather you should simply unzip one of the packages above or clone the source repository. Then make sure your Lua scripts can find its modules. It is written in pure Lua, so you don't need to compile anything.</p>

<p>There are however several dependencies. The mandatory dependencies are as follow:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://keplerproject.github.io/luafilesystem/">LuaFileSystem</a>: <code>luarocks install luafilesystem</code></li>
    <li>my <a href="https://bitbucket.org/doub/path">prtr-path</a> module: <code>luarocks install prtr-path</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The following dependencies are optional:</p>

<ul>
    <li>for font loading and text drawing:
    <ul>
        <li>my <a href="https://bitbucket.org/doub/luafreetype">LuaFreeType</a> module: <code>luarocks install freetype</code></li>
        <li>my <a href="https://bitbucket.org/doub/geometry/">geometry</a> library: this needs to be installed manually</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>to load SVG files:
    <ul>
        <li>my <a href="https://bitbucket.org/doub/xml">prtr-xml</a> module: <code>luarocks install prtr-xml</code></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>for aperture path generation (not required for panelization or general board manipulation):
    <ul>
        <li>lhf's <a href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/lua/#lgpc">lgpc</a> module: this needs to be installed manually</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Again if you're on Windows, I recommend using a <a href="http://piratery.net/grbv/downloads/">Gerber Viewer package</a>.</p>
